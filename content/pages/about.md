I am an biotechnologist by training, and currently am a PhD student
at the University of Bras√≠lia
[UnB](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-brasilia), advised by [Dr. Georgios Pappas](http://lattes.cnpq.br/6434812322607721). My research interests lie in the general area of bioinformatics, particularly in using computer and mathematics methodologies to come up with answers concerning biological questions.
